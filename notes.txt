NOTES

The original site pages were harvested by Greg Newton from the 
Wayback Machine.

Martin Holmes then massaged these pages into the valid XHTML5 
version of the site which is in the /original/ folder.

At the request of LS, one page was removed, along with references
to it, and the results are in the /tweaked/ folder. This folder
is what will be published pending a modernization, and it will
then be made available in the form of an archive alongside a 
modernized version.
