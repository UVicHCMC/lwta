                     Modifiers as Close as Possible to the Words they Modify. Squinting modifiers
                     create confusion about which word they modify. The words that most often
                     cause this problem are adverbs such as "only," "both," and "well." You
                     can avoid this problem by placing modifiers as close as possible to the
                     words they modify. Each of the four sentences below means something different
                     because the modifier "only" has been moved. Writers should never say, "Well,
                     you know what I meant." Instead, you should write precisely what you mean
                     to convey.</span><span class="f-arial">

               <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial">The judge is permitted to impose
                        only criminal sanctions after the parties have a right to be heard.</span></b></div>

               <p><br/><span class="f-arial">Third Meaning:</span>
                  </p>
               <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial">The judge is only permitted
                        to impose criminal sanctions after the parties have a right to be heard.</span></b></div>

               <p><br/><span class="f-arial">Fourth Meaning:</span>
                  </p>
               <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial">Only the judge is permitted
                        to impose criminal sanctions after the parties have a right to be heard.</span></b></div>

               <p><br/><span class="f-arial">In the first meaning, the placement
                     of "only" before "after" tells us when the judge may impose criminal sanctions.
                     In the second meaning, the placement of "only" before "criminal sanctions"
                     implies that the judge may not impose other forms of sanctions. In the
                     third meaning, the placement of "only" before "permitted" tells us that
                     while sanctions are permitted to be imposed, they are not required to be
                     imposed. In the fourth meaning, the placement of "only" tells us that the
                     judge -- but not anyone else -- is permitted to impose criminal sanctions.</span>

                     Modifiers as Close as Possible to the Words they Modify. Dangling modifiers,
                     which are often found at the beginning of a sentence, leave the reader
                     wondering who or what is being modified. In the first incorrect option
                     below, can you tell who spent several hundred hours on the case? In the
                     second incorrect option, can you tell who had tried hundreds of cases?</span>
