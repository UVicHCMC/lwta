                  Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clauses Defined. Restrictive clauses limit
                  the possible meaning of a preceding subject. Nonrestrictive clauses tell
                  you something about a preceding subject, but they do not limit, or restrict,
                  the meaning of that subject. Compare the following examples.</span></span></span></div>

                        the lineup who has red hair committed the crime.</span></span></b></div>

               <p><br/><span class="f-arial">Note how the subject "suspect" in this
                     sentence is restricted in two ways: we know that this suspect is both in
                     the lineup and has red hair. As a result, we know that the other suspects,
                     who are not in the lineup, could not have committed the crime. Moreover,
                     of those suspects in the lineup, we know that the one suspect in the lineup
                     with red hair committed the crime. If there were more than one suspect
                     in the lineup with red hair, the above usage would be incorrect because
                     it implies a different meaning.</span><span class="f-arial">

               <div><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">The suspect in
                           the lineup, who owns a red car, committed the crime.</span></span></b></div>

                  <p><br/><span class="f-arial">In this example, the restrictive clause
                        "in the lineup" tells us that of all possible suspects in the world, the
                        one who committed the crime is in the lineup. However, while the nonrestrictive
                        clause "who owns a red car" tells us something about the suspect, it does
                        not foreclose the possibility that there are several different suspects
                        in the lineup with red cars. The car color may tell us something useful,
                        but it does not restrict us to only one possibility.</span><span class="f-arial">
                        </span></p>
                  <p><span class="f-arial">2.  When choosing between "that" and
                        "which," use "that" to introduce a restrictive clause and "which" to introduce
                        a nonrestrictive clause. Although some writers use "which" to introduce
                        a restrictive clause, the traditional practice is to use "that" to introduce
                        a restrictive clause and "which" to introduce a nonrestrictive clause.
                        When writing a restrictive clause, do not place a comma before "that."
                        When writing a nonrestrictive clause, do place a comma before "which."</span>

                                 60 days old. In the nonrestrictive sentence, the store honored all the
                                 complaints, all of which were less than 60 days old.</span><span class="f-arial">

                                 nonrestrictive clauses, but do not place punctuation around restrictive
                                 clauses. When a nonrestrictive clause appears in the middle of a sentence,
                                 place commas around it. When a nonrestrictive clause appears at the end
                                 of a sentence, place a comma before it and a period after it. Do not punctuate
                                 restrictive clauses.</span>
