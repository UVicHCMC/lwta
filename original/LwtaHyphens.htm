            Hyphens</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">1.  Use a hyphen with compound adjectives.
            A compound adjective is formed when two or more adjectives work together
            to modify the same noun. These terms should be hyphenated to avoid confusion
            or ambiguity.</span>

                        Combining an adverb (usually a word ending in "ly") and an adjective does
                        not create a compound adjective. No hyphen is required because it is already
                        clear that the adverb modifies the adjective rather than any subsequent
                        term.</span>

                                             use a hyphen to divide a word at the end of a line of text. However, it
                                             is better to place the whole word on one line if that approach would not
                                             result in leaving a large space. If you need to use a hyphen, be sure to
                                             use it after a complete syllable, never in the middle of a syllable. You
                                             may want to check a dictionary for the proper syllable breakdown. (Please
                                             also note that one should never split a word at the end of a page; if necessary,
                                             move the entire word to the top of the next page.)</span><span class="f-arial">
