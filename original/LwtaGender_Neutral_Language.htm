            Gender Neutral Language</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">The use of gender-neutral language may seem
            unnecessary to some writers, but the consistent use of masculine pronouns
            leaves the impression that women could not be among the group to which
            the writer is referring. While some may respond that the masculine pronouns
            "he" and "his" refer to men and women both, the impression left is in the
            eye of the reader, not that of the writer. Because many readers read masculine
            pronouns to refer only to men, the writer, perhaps inadvertently, will
            have created the wrong impression. Furthermore, in the practice of law,
            those who use only masculine pronouns may find later -- to their great
            regret -- that the supervising attorney or judge to whom the work was submitted
            would never use masculine pronouns as general terms in her work.</span><div class="f-arial">
            
            <p><span class="f-arial">The key rule of thumb is to avoid using
                  gender-specific language; resort to alternatives like "he or she" only
                  if there is no way to write the sentence without the pronouns. In most
                  cases, one can rewrite any sentence to avoid the need for gender-based
                  pronouns. There are three methods explained below. The first of the three
                  is the most desirable. Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her;
                  "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of
                  the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language.</span>
               <br/><span class="f-arial"> <span class="f-arial">
                     </span></span></p>
            <p><span class="f-arial">1.  Rewrite the sentence to avoid
                  the need for any pronoun at all. One can often substitute the words "the"
                  or "a" for the pronoun.</span>
