            Possessives</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">When a student submits written work to a professor
            or to a law firm, no mistake will stand out more or create a more negative
            impression of that student's work than the mistaken use -- or nonuse --
            of apostrophes. It is therefore critical that you master these simple,
            yet often-confused, rules for creating possessives. In any case, the threshold
            inquiry is whether the noun "owns" something: if it does, a possessive
            form is required.</span>

                     place the apostrophe before the "s." This will indicate ownership by one

                                 </span></p>
                           <p><span class="f-arial">"Its" is a possessive, as in the sentence,
                                 "The truck lost its muffler as it entered the pothole-laden Kennedy Expressway."
                                 This is the rare case in which a possessive term does not take an apostrophe.</span><span class="f-arial">
                                 </span></p>
                           <p><span class="f-arial">"It's" is the contraction of "it is," as
                                 in the sentence, "It's best not to question the judge's knowledge of the
                                 laws of evidence in open court." In formal writing, however, one generally
                                 should not use contractions. Thus, the better formulation of the sentence
                                 above would be: "It is best not to question the judge's knowledge of the
                                 laws of evidence in open court."</span><span class="f-arial">
                                 </span></p>
                           <p><span class="f-arial">"Its'" is not a word and is a logical impossibility.
                                 The word "it" is a singular pronoun. It therefore has no plural possessive
                                 form at all. As noted above, the singular possessive form of "it" is "its."</span>

                                 the second-named person. For example:</span>
