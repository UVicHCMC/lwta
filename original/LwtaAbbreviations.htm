            Abbreviations</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">1.  In formal writing, one should not use abbreviations,
            except as indicated in rules 2, 3, and 4 below. For example:</span>
         
         <div><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: The U.S. Supreme
                     Court held that the defendant's rights had been violated.</span></span></b>
            <br/><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: The United States
                     Supreme Court held that the defendant's rights had been violated.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: Professor Jonas
                        mentioned several cities that have domestic-partnership ordinances, e.g.,
                        New York and San Francisco.</span></span></b>
               <br/><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: Professor Jonas
                        mentioned several cities that have domestic-partnership ordinances, including
                        New York and San Francisco.</span></span></b>
               </p>
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: The Court announced
                        its decision in the case on Oct. 12, 1994.</span></span></b>
               <br/><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: The Court announced

         <div class="f-arial">
            
            <p><br/><span class="f-arial">2.  When an abbreviation has become so common
                  that it has supplanted the full name in common usage, one may use the abbreviation;
                  however, one should do so without the use of periods. For example:</span></p>
         </div>
      </div>
      
      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
         
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: The
                     N.A.A.C.P. was the subject of a profile on C.B.S. last week.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: The NAACP was the
                        subject of a profile on CBS last week.</span></span></b>
               </p>
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-990000">However: The defendant in
                        the case is R.J. Reynolds Industries, Inc.</span></span></b></p>
         </div>
         <span class="f-arial">Notice that in the preceding example, the points after
            "R" and "J" should be left in, because the meaning of the abbreviation
            is not sufficiently well known to most readers. Ordinarily, one would replace
            such an abbreviation with the full terms; however, one can not do so in
            this case because the legal corporate name involved includes the abbreviation.</span>
         <br/> 
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">3.  When writing legal citations, always use
               the abbreviations required by the Bluebook. However, when referring to
               a court in text, do not abbreviate. For example:</span></p>
      </div>
      
      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
         
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: The

                     (1994).</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: The Illinois Supreme
                        Court required the return of the child to his birth mother. Smithson v.

               <br/> 
               <br/> </p>
         </div>
         </div>
      
      <div><span class="f-arial">4.  When referring to a corporate entity that
            has one or more abbreviations as part of its legal name, such as R.J. Reynolds
            Industries, Inc., leave the abbreviations in the name. Do not spell out
            the abbreviation unless the corporation itself spells it out, which some
            do (for example, Exxon Shipping Company). This rule applies to all of the
            various forms of corporate designations, including Co., Corp., Inc., and
            Ltd.</span></div>
