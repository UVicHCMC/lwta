                     of the rules of grammar, punctuation, and good writing that are most important
                     to legal writing. It also includes exercises (with answers) on each of
                     the topics discussed. Because efficiency in use is an important goal, it
                     is by necessity not a complete reference to good writing. For such a reference,
                     you may want to consult one of the commonly utilized style guides, such
                     as the Chicago Manual of Style. You will also find help in the required
                     legal writing text, Richard K. Neumann, Jr., Legal Reasoning and Legal
                     Writing (2d ed. 1994).</span></span><span class="f-arial"><span class="s-plus1"></span>

            <!--<p><span class="f-arial"><span class="s-plus1">This guide has three parts
plus a table of contents. Part I contains explanations of the rules relating
to each topic listed in the table of contents; Part II provides a series
of exercises testing your knowledge of those topics; and Part III provides
answers to those exercises.</span></span><span class="f-arial"><span class="s-plus1"/></span>
</p><p><span class="f-arial"><span class="s-plus1">You also may have this text
running in your web browser while you are writing a memorandum, brief,
or other paper in a Windows word processor, such as WordPerfect or Microsoft
Word. Thus, you can easily switch from your word processing file to this
document, and back again, if you find you need an explanation of a rule
of writing while you are preparing your paper. The exercises contained
in this guide run in your browser with the aid of a plug-in called NEURON
which needs to be installed on your computer in order to complete the exercises. 
Please download and install the plug-in from <a href="http://www.asymetrix.com/products/toolbook2/neuron/">Neuron's
Website</a>.</span></span><span class="f-arial"><span class="s-plus1"/></span>

to rewrite the exercises on your screen. It will tell you whether you have
rewritten them correctly and, if you have not, it will provide you with
the correct response.</span></span><span class="f-arial"><span class="s-plus1"/></span>
