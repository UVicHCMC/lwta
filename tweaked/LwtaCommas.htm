            Commas</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">Comma usage is one of the most complex, and
            most misunderstood, questions of proper punctuation. In some cases there
            are widely accepted rules governing comma usage; in a few cases, there
            is more than one acceptable approach. Students often think it's silly to
            worry about things such as punctuation: after all, isn't the legal analysis
            what really counts? However, when one applies for a job or submits written
            work to a supervisor, nothing will leave a more negative impression than
            ignorance of the basic rules of punctuation. After all, the last thing
            a senior attorney wants to do is correct a junior attorney's comma usage.</span><div class="f-arial">

                     but they do not limit, or restrict, the meaning. Restrictive clauses, on
                     the other hand, limit the possible meaning of the subject. Compare the

                                    items in a list, place a comma before the conjunction that precedes the

                                    Many people are taught not to place a comma before a conjunction preceding
                                    the last item in a list (such as, "red, white and blue"). However, while
