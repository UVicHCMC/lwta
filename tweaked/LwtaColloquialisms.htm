            Colloquialisms</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">Legal writing is formal writing. The primary
            goal is to communicate ideas clearly and efficiently. An occasional rhetorical
            flourish can be useful to emphasize a point, particularly in persuasive
            writing; however, one should not run the risk of losing or confusing important
            legal ideas under the weight of flowery prose. The ideas are more important
            than the prose. Similarly, one should not "write like one talks." We often
            use colorful or colloquial phrases in spoken English that are inappropriate
            in formal written English. Be sure to edit these phrases out of your written
            work, replacing them with more precise language.</span>

                        "street talk," but goes too far in the other direction and sacrifices conciseness.</span><span class="f-arial">
