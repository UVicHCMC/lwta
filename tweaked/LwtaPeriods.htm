            Periods</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">1.  Periods should be placed inside quotation
            marks. Periods always go inside quotation marks, even if they did not appear
            in the original quote. The same rule applies to commas; however, all other
            punctuation belongs outside the quotation mark, unless it appeared in the
            original quotation.</span>

                           a sentence, place two spaces after the period and before the next character.
                           This rule applies as well to citation sentences: at the end of a full citation
                           sentence, place a period followed by two spaces. However, if a period ends
                           an abbreviation not at the end of a sentence, place one space after it.
                           And if the period is in the middle of a single abbreviation, place no space
                           after it. All four of these rules are illustrated in the following examples.</span><span class="f-arial">
