            Colons</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">1.  Do not use a colon in a complete
            sentence after phrases such as "such as," "including," and "for example."
            Because phrases like these already indicate to the reader that a list of
            examples will follow, there is no need to introduce them with a colon,
            which would merely be redundant.</span>
