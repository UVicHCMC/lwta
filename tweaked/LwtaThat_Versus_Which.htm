            That Versus Which</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">The traditional approach to this question
            is to use "that" with restrictive clauses and "which" with nonrestrictive
            clauses. While some writers seem to have abandoned the distinction entirely,
            no better rule has come along to replace the traditional rule. Moreover,
            the rule is easy to master.</span>

               <p><span class="f-arial">1.  Use "that" with restrictive clauses.
                     A restrictive clause is one that limits -- or restricts --the identity
                     of the subject in some way. When writing a restrictive clause, introduce
                     it with the word "that" and no comma. (However, if the subject is or was
                     a human being, use "who" to introduce the clause.)</span><span class="f-arial">

                  <p><br/><span class="f-arial">Explanation: The use of "that" in this
                        sentence is correct if the reader intends to single out the one painting
                        that was in the foyer as the stolen painting. However, if there were several
                        paintings hanging in the foyer, this use would be incorrect, since it would
                        mislead the reader into believing that there had been only one painting
                        in the foyer. The restriction here tells us that the one painting that
                        had been hanging in the foyer was stolen -- not the painting in the living
                        room, or the one in the drawing room, or any of those in the parlor.</span>

                  <p><span class="f-arial">2.  Use "which" with nonrestrictive
                        clauses. A nonrestrictive clause may tell us something interesting or incidental
                        about a subject, but it does not define that subject. When writing a nonrestrictive
                        clause, introduce it with "which" and insert commas around the clause.
                        (However, if the subject is or was a human being, use "who" to introduce
                        the clause and insert commas around the clause.)</span><span class="f-arial">

                           use tells us that the painting was hanging in the foyer, it does not tell
                           us which of the several paintings in the foyer was the stolen painting.
                           It would be incorrect to use this nonrestrictive clause if there had been
                           only one painting in the foyer, as the sentence leaves open the possibility
                           that there were others.</span>

                                 Gogh that was hanging in the foyer, which we purchased in 1929 for $10,000,
                                 was stolen.</span></span></b></div>
                     <span class="f-arial">Explanation: The restrictive clause beginning
                        with "that" tells us that there was only one Van Gogh hanging in the foyer
                        and that it was stolen. The nonrestrictive clause beginning with "which"
                        tells us what the owner had paid for the painting, but it does not tell
                        us that the owner did not pay another $10,000 for another painting in the
                        same year. It does not limit the possibilities to the Van Gogh that was
                        in the foyer.</span>

                                 Clauses beginning with "Who." When writing about human beings, we use "who"
                                 rather than "that" or "which" to introduce a clause telling us something
                                 about that human being. Since "who" is the only option, we distinguish
                                 between a restrictive use and a nonrestrictive use by the use of commas.</span><span class="f-arial">

                                       in the lineup who has red hair committed the crime.</span></span></b></div>
                           <span class="f-arial">Note how the subject "suspect" in this sentence
                              is restricted in two ways: we know that this suspect is both in the lineup
                              and has red hair. As a result, we know that the other suspects, who are
                              not in the lineup, could not have committed the crime. Moreover, of those
                              suspects in the lineup, we know that the one suspect in the lineup with
                              red hair committed the crime. If there were more than one suspect in the
                              lineup with red hair, the above usage would be incorrect because it implies
                              a different meaning.</span><div class="f-arial">

                                          in the lineup, who owns a red car, committed the crime.</span></span></b></div>
                              <span class="f-arial">In this example, the restrictive clause "in
                                 the lineup" tells us that of all possible suspects in the world, the one
                                 who committed the crime is in the lineup. However, while the nonrestrictive
                                 clause "who owns a red car" tells us something about the suspect, it does
                                 not foreclose the possibility that there are several different suspects
                                 in the lineup with red cars. The car color may tell us something useful,
                                 but it does not restrict us to only one possibility.</span>
