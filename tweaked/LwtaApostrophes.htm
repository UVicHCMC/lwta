            <span class="f-arial">Apostrophes</span></h1>
         <span class="f-arial">When a student submits written work to a professor
            or to a law firm, no mistake will stand out more or create a more negative
            impression of that student's work than the mistaken use -- or nonuse --
            of apostrophes. It is therefore critical that you master these simple,
            yet often-confused, rules.</span>
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">There are four situations that are often
               confused. These are the use or nonuse of apostrophes in (i) plural words,
               (ii) singular possessive terms, (iii) plural possessive terms, and (iv)
               the contraction and possessive forms of it's and its. When considering
               whether a term should be possessive, first ask yourself whether ownership
               is involved. If it is, the noun or pronoun should take the possessive form.</span>
            </p>
         <p><span class="f-arial">1. Plain plural words do not require the
               use of an apostrophe. For example:</span>
            </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect:
                     The lawyer's could generally be found after hours at the Hanover Street
                     Bar and Grill. (The apostrophe here incorrectly indicates a singular possessive.)</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: The
                        lawyers' could generally be found after hours at the Hanover Street Bar
                        and Grill. (The apostrophe here incorrectly indicates a plural possessive.)</span></span></b>
               </p>
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: The lawyers
                        could generally be found after hours at the Hanover Street Bar and Grill.
                        (The lack of an apostrophe here correctly indicates a plural, nonpossessive
                        term.)</span></span></b></p>
         </div>
         <br/> 
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">2. In singular possessive terms, place
               the apostrophe before the "s." This will indicate ownership by one person
               or thing. For example:</span>
            </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect:
                     Our schools collection included an original set of Blackstone's Commentaries.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: Our
                        schools' collection included an original set of Blackstone's Commentaries.</span></span></b>
               </p>
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: Our school's
                        collection included an original set of Blackstone's Commentaries.</span></span></b></p>
         </div>
         <br/> 
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">3. In plural possessive terms, place the
               apostrophe after the "s." This will indicate to the reader that more than
               one person or thing owns the thing possessed.</span>
            </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect:
                     The students success was largely attributable to their hard work and dedication.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect: The
                        student's success was largely attributable to their hard work and dedication.</span></span></b>
               </p>
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: The students'
                        success was largely attributable to their hard work and dedication.</span></span></b>
               <br/> </p>
         </div>
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">4. How to distinguish "its" and "it's."</span>
            </p>
         <p><span class="f-arial">"It's" is the contraction of "it is," as
               in the sentence, "It's best not to question the judge's knowledge of the
               laws of evidence in open court." In formal writing, however, one generally
               should not use contractions. Thus, the better formulation of the sentence
               above would be: "It is best not to question the judge's knowledge of the
               laws of evidence in open court."</span>
            </p>
         <p><span class="f-arial">"Its" is a possessive, as in the sentence,
               "The truck lost its muffler as it entered the pothole-laden Kennedy Expressway."
               This is the rare case in which a possessive term does not take an apostrophe.</span>
            <br/> 
            <br/> 
            </p>
         <p><span class="f-arial">5. A less-often faced decision involves
               the use of apostrophes where multiple owners are named. Where two or more
               people own one item jointly, place an apostrophe before an "s" only after
               the second-named person. For example:</span>
            </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect:
                     Bill's and Mary's car was a lemon, leading them to seek rescission of their
                     contract under the state's lemon law.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: Bill
                        and Mary's car was a lemon, leading them to seek rescission of their contract
                        under the state's lemon law.</span></span></b></p>
         </div>
         
         <p><br/><span class="f-arial">However, when two or more people own
               two or more items separately, each individual's name should take the possessive
               form. For example:</span>
            </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Incorrect:
                     Joanne and Todd's cars were bought from the same dealer; both proved useless,
                     even though Joanne's car was an import and Todd's was a domestic model.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">Correct: Joanne's
                        and Todd's cars were bought from the same dealer; both proved useless,
                        even though Joanne's car was an import and Todd's was a domestic model.</span></span></b></p>
         </div>
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">6. When creating the possessive form of
               words ending in "s," use only an apostrophe after the "s" if the word ends
               in a "z" sound. However, if the word ends in an "s" sound use an apostrophe
               and an additional "s" to create the possessive.</span>
            </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-ff0000">Less
                     Desirable: He was a student in Professor Adams's class.</span></span></b>
            
            <p><b><span class="f-arial"><span class="c-009900">More Desirable:
