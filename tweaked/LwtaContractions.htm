            <p><br/><span class="f-arial">1.  Avoid using contractions in
                  formal writing. A contraction is a combination of two words as one, such
                  as "don't," "can't," and "isn't." The use of contractions is inappropriate
                  in formal legal writing. Replace them with the two-word version of the
                  contraction.</span>
