            Ellipses</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">An ellipsis is a series of three points with
            spaces between them (. . .) inserted into a quotation to indicate the omission
            of material from the original quotation. There are quite a few simple rules
            for the proper use of ellipses, which are used more often in legal writing
            than most forms of writing, since lawyers often (generally too often) quote
            material from other sources. Failure to use the proper form of an ellipsis
            could misrepresent the work of another person and result in legal liability
            for the writer. Correct use of ellipses, on the other hand, shows that
            the writer has carefully attended to detail, and thus increases the reader's
            confidence in the reliability of the written work.</span>

                              omitted in the midst of the quoted material. The brackets around the "T"
                              indicate that the letter was lower case in the original and was changed
                              to upper case by the writer to create a proper sentence. The brackets also
                              confirm that material at the start of the second quoted sentence was omitted,
                              because the letter "T" would have been capitalized in the original, and
                              therefore would require no brackets, if it had started a sentence. For
