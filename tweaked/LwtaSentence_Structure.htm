            Sentence Structure</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">There are three basic kinds of sentences:
            simple, compound, and complex. They are formed by using one or more independent
            and dependent clauses and phrases. An independent clause can stand alone
            as a sentence, while a dependent clause or a phrase can not. A phrase is
            distinguished from a dependent clause by its lack of a necessary subject.
            The phrase "sentence fragment" is often appended to a student's work when
            a professor sees a dependent clause or phrase standing on its own.</span><div class="f-arial">
            
            <p><span class="f-arial">If you understand the difference between
                  a dependent clause and an independent clause, you will be able to write
                  proper sentences. You also will be able to form proper compound sentences
                  (which consist of two or more independent clauses) and complex sentences
                  (which consist of one or more dependent clauses and at least one independent
                  clause).</span>
               <br/><span class="f-arial"> <span class="f-arial">
                     </span></span></p>
            <p><span class="f-arial">1.  Do not leave dependent clauses
                  or phrases standing alone; these are sentence fragments, not sentences.
                  Sentence fragments often contain a verb with no subject (creating a dependent
                  clause or a phrase). A writer who makes this error will invite the ridicule
                  of more experienced writers. The best way to avoid the problem is to be
                  certain that every sentence has at least one subject linked to each verb.
                  You also can avoid the problem by attaching the fragment to an independent
                  clause with a conjunction, a comma, or both. Be careful, however, not to
                  attach two independent clauses with a comma. This error, known as a comma
                  splice, is discussed in rule 2.</span><span class="f-arial">

                        In the corrected version, the pronoun "it," referring to the appellate
                        court, is the subject of the verb "affirmed."</span><span class="f-arial">
