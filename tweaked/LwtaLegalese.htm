            Legalese</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">1.  Do not use legal argot in an effort
            to "sound like a lawyer." There are many words and phrases one might associate
            with legal writing but which have a tendency to obscure the meaning of
            a sentence. Although you will see that some of these words are used by
            judges and authors of legal texts, particularly in older texts, you should
            not use them yourself. The rule of thumb of modern legal writing is that
            a lawyer's language, whenever possible, must be clear and concise enough
            to be understood by a lay client. Do not use so-called legal terminology
            unless general terminology would be less precise.</span><div class="f-arial">

                        heretofore, the landlord's conduct created, caused, and resulted in serious
                        bodily harm and massive injuries, to wit: a broken and mangled left leg,
                        lacerations to the aforementioned leg, and several broken digits on the
                        foot attached to said leg, in witness whereof was the spouse of the injured
                        party.</span></span></b><div class="f-arial">

               <p><span class="f-arial">2.  Do not use long introductory (throat
                     clearing) phrases that add no special meaning. Use of phrases such as "the
                     defense contends" and "it is important to emphasize that" generally add
                     no substantive meaning to a sentence. Making matters worse, they prevent
                     the reader from quickly reaching the important part of the sentence and
                     may result in a loss of emphasis. As a general rule, one should get to
                     the important point quickly.</span><span class="f-arial">

                  is only a contention, not a fact, then the first usage is acceptable. However,
                  if you represent the plaintiff, it does your client a disservice to suggest
                  this is only a contention. If it's a fact, state it without introduction.</span>

                           art if they are more precise than general terminology and if you are writing
                           to a professional audience. The beginning law student will have difficulty
                           knowing when a term of art is likely to be well understood, as they all
                           are new to the beginner. However, as time progresses, new law students
                           will develop an easy familiarity with terms of art and the decision whether
                           to use them will be less difficult.</span><span class="f-arial">

                        use would therefore be appropriate in writing a memorandum to a supervising
                        attorney or a brief to a judge, but might not be appropriate in a letter
                        to a lay client.</span>
