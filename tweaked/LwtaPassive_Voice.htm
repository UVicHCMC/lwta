            Passive Voice</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">Active voice is distinguished from passive
            voice by the identity of the actor. As a general rule, active voice is
            preferred because it meets two of the most important requirements of legal
            writing: clarity and conciseness. Active voice is clearer because it focuses
            the reader's attention on the "doer of the action"; it is also more concise
            simply because it usually involves fewer words.</span>
         <br/><span class="f-arial">While any single use of the passive voice
            is not technically incorrect, the repeated use of passive voice produces
            a sluggish, ponderous text. However, there are a limited number of situations
            -- explained below -- where using passive voice is preferable. The good
            writer will actively seek to avoid the passive voice unless presented with
            a strong justification for its use.</span>

                              trying to hide the identity of the actor. In the following example, the
                              writer (defense counsel) prefers not to use the active voice in order to
                              avoid focusing attention on the identity of the actor.</span><span class="f-arial">

                                    greater emphasis on the main point of the sentence.</span><span class="f-arial">
                                    </span></p>
                              <p><span class="f-arial">If use of the active voice diminishes the
                                    point of the sentence, one may use passive voice instead. In the following
                                    example, the writer achieves a greater emphasis on poor people -- rather
                                    than the legislature -- by using the passive voice.</span><span class="f-arial">

                                          a multi-part subject. If the subject of the sentence is so long or complex
                                          that the reader will be long delayed in reaching the verb, then the writer
                                          may choose to place the verb before the subject. Either of the approaches
                                          below may be acceptable for a given audience. For example, a professional
                                          audience is less likely than a lay audience to be confused by the delay
                                          in reaching the verb.</span><span class="f-arial">
