            Quotation Incorporation</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">New law students face many complications when
            incorporating quotations from other sources into their own work. These
            fall into three general categories: creating a grammatically correct sentence
            that includes the quoted material; using brackets properly; and using ellipses
            properly. In addition, new law students (and many practicing lawyers) tend
            to quote far too often. This guide has separate sections on using brackets,
            ellipses, and quotation marks. Be sure to review those sections carefully
            because mastery of the rules there does not come naturally to most legal
            writers. This section focuses on creating proper sentences when incorporating
            quotations, on certain technical rules for quoting, and on avoiding quotations
            when possible.</span>

               <p><span class="f-arial">1.  Be careful to avoid quoting excessively;
                     paraphrase whenever possible. New law students sometimes believe, incorrectly,
                     that they should always quote a judge's words. After all, the thinking
                     goes, the judge must know the best way to express the law. However, excessive
                     quotation is a poor substitute for analysis. Your job as a lawyer is to
                     analyze precedent, not just repeat it. Thus, your writing should explain
                     to your reader why and how a precedent is important to your client. You
                     can not accomplish that important interpretive function merely by stringing
                     quotes together. Moreover, stringing together quotations from cases and
                     secondary sources tends to produce a choppy, incoherent text. It is generally
                     better to use your own words so that the text you write will have a logical
                     progression and consistent style from sentence to sentence.</span><span class="f-arial">
                     </span></p>
               <p><span class="f-arial">A paraphrase is the expression of another's
                     ideas in one's own words. You may paraphrase existing material as long
                     as you provide a proper citation after the paraphrase. You should not put
                     quotation marks around paraphrased material. The citation indicates that
                     the ideas are from another source; the lack of quotation marks indicates
                     that the words chosen to express those ideas are your own. Well-paraphrased
                     material will change the majority of the key words from the original source.
                     If your paraphrase retains words of special significance from the original
                     source, put quotation marks around those words only.</span><span class="f-arial">

                           purport but to counsel the violation of law cannot by any latitude of interpretation
                           be a part of that public opinion which is the final source of government

                                       or particular eloquence. From time to time, one comes across a phrase or
                                       sentence so well written that to paraphrase it would be almost criminal.
                                       Other phrases may have become part of the lore of legal writing, and to
                                       the knowledgeable reader a paraphrase would seem silly. These phrases are
                                       rare, but when you find them, feel free to quote them. They can be particularly
                                       effective in a memorandum or brief prepared for a court. Sometimes, one
                                       would lose the effectiveness of the quote unless it is left freestanding.
                                       In that case, one should disregard the general rule against freestanding
                                       quotations. The following are a few examples.</span>

                              of 50 words or longer. Many readers skip over block quotes because they
                              are looking for explanations of the law, rather than mere reprinting. Don't
                              use block quotes unless (i) there is simply no other way to write what
                              you intend to convey (extremely rare) or (ii) the words are so eloquent
                              that to paraphrase them would seriously undermine the persuasiveness of
                              your text.</span>

                              be sure to indent and single space. Quotations of 50 words or longer should
                              be indented at both the left and right margins by approximately one-half
                              inch in each case. They should be typed in single-space format, and the
                              citation for the quote should be placed two lines down from the end of
                              the quote and at the original left margin. Do not place quotation marks
                              around such a quote: the reader will know it is a quote because you have
                              indented it. However, if there are quotations within the blocked quote,
                              then do use citations around these internal quotations. The following is
                              an example of a properly blocked quotation of 50 words or more.</span>
