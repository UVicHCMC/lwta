            <span class="f-arial">Articles</span></h1>
         <span class="f-arial">The term "articles" refers to the three words
            "a," "an," and "the." Students sometimes leave articles out of their sentences
            in an effort to be more efficient or to "sound like a lawyer." However,
            the result of leaving articles out is bad writing. Use articles wherever
            they are required: there is no "lawyers' exception." Students whose native
            language is an Asian language should be particularly careful to check for
            the proper use of articles when writing in English, since articles are
            not used in many Asian languages.</span>
         
         <p><span class="f-arial">1. Avoid Lawyers' Noises. Leaving an article
               out of a sentence will not make it much more concise, but it will make
               the sentence more difficult to read. Don't try to write "like a lawyer":
               it is far better that your writing be considered literate than lawyer-like.</span>

               general rule is simple: use "a" before nouns beginning with a consonant
               and "an" before nouns beginning with a vowel. The more difficult question,
               discussed below in item 3, is how to deal with vowel sounds and voiced
               consonants.</span>

         <p><span class="f-arial">3. Vowel Sounds and Voiced Consonants.
               Sometimes a word begins with a consonant, but sounds as if it begins with
               a vowel (thus, "vowel sounds"). These words should be treated as if they
               start with a vowel in deciding which article to use. The most common among
               these are words beginning with the letter "h" (such as "hour" and "heir").
               However, if you pronounce the consonant ("voiced consonants"), then use
               the article "a," as you would with most other consonants. Thus, the word
               "heir" begins with a vowel sound, while the word "hotel" begins with a
               voiced consonant.</span>
