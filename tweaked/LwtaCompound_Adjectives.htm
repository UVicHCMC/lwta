                  when two or more adjectives work together to modify the same noun. These
                  terms should be hyphenated to avoid confusion or ambiguity.</span>

                        a word ending in "ly") and an adjective does not create a compound adjective.
                        No hyphen is required because it is already clear that the adverb modifies
                        the adjective rather than the subsequent noun.</span>
