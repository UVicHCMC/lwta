            Dashes</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">Dashes can be used to set off material in
            the midst of a sentence. However, one should try to avoid using them at
            all. When choosing between dashes and other forms of punctuation (such
            as commas and parentheses), dashes should be used sparingly and primarily
            when the material deserves special emphasis. By contrast, parenthetical
            ideas may be lost. In typing or word processing, a dash is formed by placing
            one space before and one space after two consecutive hyphens.</span>
