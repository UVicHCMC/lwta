      I would like to thank Professors Suzanne Ehrenberg and Molly Warner Lien
      for their support of this project.  I am especially indebted to Professor Susan
      Adams for her careful reading and editing of an earlier draft.  Her
      suggestions have made this a better learning and teaching tool.  Rosemary Shiels,
      Director of the Chicago-Kent College of Law Center for Law and Computers, and Jeff
      Harrison, a second-year law student working for the Center, provided invaluable
      support in creating and programming the computer-software version of this guide. 
      I am also grateful to Dominick Grillo, Manager of Chicago-Kent's Electronic
      Publishing and Computer Resources Group, for his important contributions in the
      editing and testing of this program.
