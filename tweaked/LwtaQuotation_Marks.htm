            Quotation Marks</h1>
         
         <p><br/><span class="f-arial">1.  Place commas and periods inside,
               not outside, quotation marks. Place all other punctuation outside quotation
               marks unless it was contained in the original source. Follow this practice
               whether or not the comma is part of the original quotation. The general
               rule is that commas and periods should be inside the quotation marks at
               all times, while all other forms of punctuation, such as question marks,
               colons, semicolons, and exclamation points, should be outside the quotation
               marks, unless they were contained in the original quotation.</span>

            <p><br/><span class="f-arial">Explanation: In the second set of examples,
                  the question mark is part of the original quotation from Phaedrus and should
                  therefore be placed inside the quotation marks. However, in the third set
                  of examples, the exclamation point is supplied by the writer and is therefore
                  properly placed outside the quotation marks.</span>

            <p><span class="f-arial">2.  Use single quotation marks if
                  one quote appears inside a longer quote. The use of single quotation marks
                  around an internal quotation enables the reader to easily distinguish the
                  internal quote from the material surrounding it. As such, single marks
                  also allow the reader to determine from which source the internally quoted
                  material was drawn.</span>
