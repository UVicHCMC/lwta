            Dependant Clauses and Phrases</h1>
         <span class="f-arial">Knowing how to distinguish a dependent clause
            or a phrase from an independent clause will help you to use punctuation
            correctly and construct proper sentences. A dependent clause or a phrase
            can not stand alone as a sentence. It is therefore dependent on other words
            being added to it to create a sentence. An independent clause, by contrast,
            can stand alone as a sentence, or it can be combined with one or more other
            clauses or phrases to form a complex sentence, through the proper use of
            punctuation and conjunctions.</span></div>

            <br/><span class="f-arial">1.  Dependent Clauses Not Constituting
               a Sentence ("Sentence Fragments") -- Students sometimes write a dependent
               clause when they think they are writing a sentence. This is one of the
               worst writing errors one can make. Dependent clauses left standing alone
               are often referred to as sentence fragments. While they contain a subject
               and a verb, they nonetheless represent incomplete thoughts. Be sure that
               you understand the difference between a dependent clause and a sentence.
               The following are examples of dependent clauses that, like all such clauses,
               do not constitute sentences.</span>

                        Sentences. One generally can turn any dependent clause (or a series of
                        dependent clauses) into a sentence by combining it with an independent
                        clause and one or more punctuation marks or conjunctions.</span>

                              A phrase is different from a dependent clause because unlike the dependent
                              clause it generally lacks a subject. However, like a dependent clause,
                              it can not stand alone and is dependent on a clause being added. The following
                              are a few examples of phrases.</span>
